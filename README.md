Esca is an iOS application built to bring money-saving food lovers together!

On launch the default user location is set to 35.253953, -120.694159. This will
allow you to see the set of deals we currently have.

In "DealViewController" we start monitoring a geofence around Apple HQ.
Please Use LocationTest.gpx when mocking location and close the app when performing the test
to see the local user notification
